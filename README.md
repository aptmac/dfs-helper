# Daily Fantasy Helper

## What is it?

This repository contains a couple of Python scripts that automate the creation of daily fantasy football rosters.

## How to use:

`> python fetch_data.py`

`> python dfs-solver.py <file>`

## Example output:
```
                     name position team  salary  points

```

## Does it work?

Yeah, kind of.

The Yahoo projected points are hot garbage, so I wouldn't advice using them.

The Fantasy Pros ones are great out of the box. I went undefeated in the Yahoo DFS placement matches, and have since won a couple of larger paid contests and for-money head-to-head matches. The coolest win so far has been in the BetMGM Yahoo Cup, which is a free to enter contest and only awards money to the top scorers. I placed 972 out of 142,492 which ended up giving me a whopping $1, but free money is free money and that placement was very cool!
